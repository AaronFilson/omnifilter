# Running on more GPUs: a plan

Omnifilter was built and tested on one machine: a 2015 MacBook Pro with an Intel Iris 6100 (OpenCL 1.2, macOS 12), plus pocl on the CPU in Docker. This document is the plan for running well on everything else: other GPU vendors, other operating systems, containers, the cloud and the browser.

*Written October 2026. Driver and API support changes quickly, so the "today" columns below should be re-checked before each phase starts.*

## Where things stand

The design already helps here. Filters don't talk to OpenCL directly. They build a **plan**: a list of named buffers and kernel passes (`server/lib/filters/plan.js`), which the native addon runs (`native/omnifilter.cpp`). The plan format says nothing OpenCL-specific beyond kernel names and argument types, so a second backend can run the same plans.

The kernels: 53 kernels in about 1,500 lines of OpenCL C 1.2 (`native/kernels/*.cl`). 14 of them read images (textures), the histogram and Voronoi kernels use atomics, and none use double precision.

Assumptions baked in that won't hold everywhere:

| Assumption | Where | Breaks on |
|---|---|---|
| Banded launches use 16x16 work-groups | `omnifilter.cpp`, band loop | Devices whose maximum work-group size or shape is smaller, e.g. Apple's CPU device (1024x1x1), some mobile GPUs |
| Images (textures) are supported, up to 16384 px per side | 14 kernels; `image_codec.js` caps input at 16384 | OpenCL 3.0 devices without image support; GPUs with 8192 limits |
| The first device of the wanted type is the right one | `PickDevice` | Machines with an integrated *and* a discrete GPU, or several platforms (e.g. pocl and a vendor driver) |
| Every kernel is short enough to dodge the display watchdog | banding sizes tuned by hand on the Iris 6100 | Slower GPUs (watchdog kills), and needlessly slow on compute GPUs with no watchdog |
| The whole image fits in one device allocation | `CL_DEVICE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE` check | GPUs with small allocation limits (often 1/4 of memory) at 50 MP |
| macOS or Linux, x64 | `binding.gyp` | Windows (no OpenCL headers or library configured); prebuilt binaries for arm64 |

## The situations to cover

| Situation | OpenCL today | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| macOS, Intel GPU | Works (this machine) | Keep |
| macOS, Apple Silicon | Apple still ships OpenCL 1.2, but it has been deprecated since 2018 and gets no fixes | Phase 0 testing now; WebGPU backend (Phase 3) is the long-term path |
| Linux, NVIDIA | NVIDIA driver includes OpenCL 3.0 | Phase 0 (device choice, work-group sizes), Phase 2 (Docker) |
| Linux, AMD | ROCm OpenCL, or Mesa's Rusticl on radeonsi | Phase 0, Phase 2 |
| Linux, Intel | Intel compute-runtime for Gen12 (Tiger Lake) and newer; Gen8-Gen11 only have a frozen legacy runtime since late 2024. Rusticl on iris covers both | Phase 0, Phase 2 |
| Linux, Arm Mali / Qualcomm Adreno (boards, Chromebooks, Asahi Macs) | Mesa's Rusticl now enables Panfrost, Freedreno and Asahi by default ([Phoronix](https://phoronix.com/news/Rusticl-2026)) | Phase 0 is the main work: these devices are the most likely to hit the work-group and image assumptions |
| Windows, NVIDIA / AMD / Intel | Vendor drivers include OpenCL | Phase 1 (build on Windows) |
| Windows on Arm | Microsoft's OpenCL-on-D3D12 layer (OpenCLOn12) | Phase 1, then WebGPU |
| WSL2 | Intel GPUs have OpenCL in WSL2 ([Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-oneAPI-L0-WSL2)); NVIDIA provides CUDA there, not OpenCL | Falls back to CPU (pocl) until the WebGPU backend |
| Docker on a Linux GPU host | Possible, but needs the vendor's OpenCL driver passed in | Phase 2 |
| Docker on macOS / Windows | No GPU access; pocl on the CPU (current image) | Keep; it's the "works anywhere" baseline |
| Cloud GPU instance (NVIDIA T4/L4/A10 etc.) | NVIDIA OpenCL | Phase 2's NVIDIA image |
| No GPU | pocl, or Apple's CPU device | Keep, fix the work-group bug (Phase 0) |
| The user's browser | n/a | Phase 4: WebGPU live preview |

## Phase 0: make the OpenCL path portable

Cheap, and it fixes real bugs. Everything else builds on it.

**Status (October 2026): done, with three changes from the plan below.** The whole test suite now passes on Apple's CPU device as well as the GPU (it was 124 of 166). Work-group sizes, device choice (`npm run devices`), fitting buffers and textures to the device, adaptive band sizes and the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) are in. The changes:
* *Suggested work-group size query:* not used. Passes without a work-group size already let the driver choose, and banded passes want square tiles, which the query wouldn't give.
* *Kernels without images:* devices without image support hide the 14 texture filters instead of getting buffer-based copies of them. Such devices are rare (every desktop GPU, pocl, Rusticl and clvk support images), and the copies would double those kernels.
* *Tiling:* filters too big for the device run on a scaled-down copy instead of being split into exact tiles. On this machine everything fits at the 50 megapixel limit; exact tiling can come later if a small-memory GPU needs it.
* *Still to check:* the CI workflow hasn't run yet (the Rusticl job in particular), since that needs the repository pushed to GitHub.

1. **Ask the device for its limits instead of assuming them.** At init, read `CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_ITEM_SIZES`, `CL_DEVICE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE`, `CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT`, `CL_DEVICE_IMAGE2D_MAX_WIDTH/HEIGHT`, `CL_DEVICE_IMAGE3D_MAX_*`, `CL_DEVICE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE`, `CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE` and `CL_DEVICE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE`, and for each kernel `CL_KERNEL_WORK_GROUP_SIZE`. Expose them through `deviceInfo()`.
   * Banded launches pick a tile that fits: 16x16 where allowed, otherwise the largest shape the device and kernel accept (e.g. 64x1). This fixes `OMNIFILTER_DEVICE=cpu` on macOS. On OpenCL 3.1 drivers, use the new suggested work-group size query (`clGetKernelSuggestedLocalWorkSizeKHR`) instead of guessing, keeping the fallback for OpenCL 1.2 (Apple).
   * Kernels that use `__local` arrays (histograms) check that the local memory fits.
   * The image size cap in `image_codec.js` comes from the device instead of the constant 16384.
2. **Choosing a device.** Add `native.devices()` listing every platform and device, and let `OMNIFILTER_DEVICE` also take a name fragment or index (`OMNIFILTER_DEVICE="RTX"`, `OMNIFILTER_DEVICE=1`). By default prefer a discrete GPU over an integrated one, and skip a device whose kernel compile fails, logging why, instead of giving up.
3. **Fallbacks for missing features.**
   * Devices without image support: give `common.cl` a buffer-based `sample_bilinear()` helper and compile with `-D NO_IMAGES`. The 14 texture kernels get a buffer path, and the addon then passes buffers where plans ask for `img`.
   * Very large images, or GPUs with small allocations: tile the image. Run the plan on overlapping tiles, each with a halo as wide as the filter's reach, and stitch the results. Filters declare their reach (e.g. blur radius); whole-image filters (equalize, auto levels) need a global first pass and opt out.
4. **Watchdog-aware banding.** Only GPUs that drive a display have a watchdog. Time the first band of each banded pass and size later bands to stay under ~0.5 s: big bands on compute GPUs and in Docker, small ones on laptops.
5. **Test kernels on several OpenCL implementations in CI.** pocl (already used in Docker) and Mesa's Rusticl are two independent compilers that run in plain GitHub Actions runners, Rusticl on llvmpipe (Mesa's software rasteriser) or on lavapipe through Zink. Running the existing reference tests on both catches most "works on my driver" bugs before they reach real GPUs. Precision differs a little between vendors, so tolerances may need to be per-test rather than "within 1".

## Phase 1: build and ship on every OS

**Status (October 2026): in progress.** Done so far:
* The addon is loaded by `server/lib/native.js` (instead of the `bindings` package), and `npm install` runs `scripts/install-native.js`, which downloads a prebuilt binary matching a hash of the native source, checks its SHA-256 and that it loads, and otherwise compiles. A missing OpenCL runtime no longer stops the server starting.
* `.github/workflows/prebuilds.yml` builds the addon for linux-x64 and linux-arm64 (on Debian 11, for older glibc), darwin-arm64 and darwin-x64 (cross-compiled), and win32-x64 and win32-arm64 (OpenCL headers from vcpkg), and checks each loads. Publishing them to the `native-prebuilds` release is a manual run of the workflow for now (not yet done); it could run automatically on every native change.
* CI also builds and loads the addon on Windows, and on macOS checks every filter if the runner has an OpenCL device.
* `GET /device` and a line in the page show which device the filters run on.
* CI found that Mesa's Rusticl (llvmpipe) crashes in `sin`, `cos` and `tan`. Kernels for Rusticl devices are compiled with a workaround that uses `sinpi`/`cospi` instead (see `common.cl`); the per-filter `npm run check-device` found it.

1. **Windows:** have `binding.gyp` find the Khronos OpenCL headers and ICD loader (vcpkg's `opencl` package or the Khronos OpenCL-SDK). Every vendor driver installs its runtime behind that one loader.
2. **Prebuilt binaries:** build the addon in CI for linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64, win32-x64 and win32-arm64 with `prebuildify`, so `npm install` doesn't need a compiler. N-API is ABI-stable, so one binary per platform covers every Node version.
3. **Show what was picked:** the server already logs the device at startup. Add `GET /device` so the page can show "running on: NVIDIA RTX 4060 (OpenCL 3.0)" or "CPU (pocl)".

## Phase 2: GPUs in Docker

The current image uses pocl so it runs anywhere. Add image variants that use the host's GPU on Linux, picked with Docker Compose profiles:

| Variant | Image contents | Run with |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu` (default) | pocl | nothing extra (works on macOS and Windows hosts too) |
| `nvidia` | OpenCL ICD loader only; the driver comes from the host | NVIDIA Container Toolkit, `gpus: all`. Its default `compute` capability mounts the host's OpenCL library and ICD file ([NVIDIA docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/1.20.1/docker-specialized.html)) |
| `intel` | `intel-opencl-icd` | `devices: [/dev/dri]` |
| `amd` | ROCm OpenCL runtime, or Mesa Rusticl | `devices: [/dev/kfd, /dev/dri]` |

Each variant keeps pocl as a fallback (the default `OMNIFILTER_DEVICE=auto` prefers the GPU and falls back to it), and the startup log warns when no GPU is visible, the most common container mistake.

## Phase 3: a second backend, WebGPU

OpenCL's future is uneven. Apple has deprecated it, and NVIDIA doesn't offer it under WSL2. A second backend makes Omnifilter independent of any one vendor's OpenCL.

**Why WebGPU rather than Metal, CUDA or Vulkan directly.** One WebGPU port runs on Metal (Apple), Vulkan (Linux, Android) and Direct3D 12 (Windows), and the same shader code runs in the browser (Phase 4). Writing Metal, CUDA and Vulkan backends separately would mean three ports of the 53 kernels.

**Kernel language: try Slang first.** [Slang](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-group-launches-slang-initiative-hosting-open-source-compiler-contributed-by-nvidia), now a Khronos project, compiles one kernel source to WGSL, Metal, SPIR-V (Vulkan), HLSL (D3D12) and CUDA, with readable output. Writing the kernels in Slang instead of hand-written WGSL would give the browser preview (Phase 4) and, later, native Metal or CUDA backends from the same source. Start with a short trial: port `blend_layers`, `color_matrix` and one texture-sampling kernel, run the generated WGSL under Dawn and in a browser, and compare speed and readability with the OpenCL versions. If it falls short, write WGSL by hand as below.

**How:**
1. Put a backend interface in front of the addon in `gpu_filters.js`: `init()`, `deviceInfo()` and `run(rgba, width, height, plan)`. The OpenCL addon becomes one implementation, and `OMNIFILTER_BACKEND=opencl|webgpu` picks one.
2. Implement the WebGPU backend in JavaScript with the `webgpu` npm package, Google's Dawn engine for Node (`create()` takes a `backend` and an `adapter` option) ([dawn.node](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webgpu@0.4.0/README.md)). Plans map closely: buffers become storage buffers, `img` arguments become textures, and each pass becomes a compute dispatch.
3. Port the kernels (to Slang, or WGSL directly) under the same names, cheapest first: the per-pixel colour, blend and adjust kernels; then convolution and the distortions (texture sampling); then the histogram kernels (WGSL has workgroup atomics); then the heavy stylize and generative kernels. Each kernel is done when it passes the existing reference tests, which get a backend parameter.
4. Things to plan around:
   * Float textures aren't filterable without the `float32-filterable` feature, so the 3D LUTs use `rgba16float`.
   * WGSL has no `#include`, so common helpers get prepended the way `common.cl` is now.
   * Dispatch sizes are capped at 65535 workgroups per dimension, so very wide images need 2D dispatch maths.

**Caveat:** Dawn's Node bindings are still marked work in progress (v0.4, and Dawn's notes list known CTS failures). So OpenCL stays the default, and WebGPU starts as opt-in on the platforms where OpenCL is weak: Apple Silicon, Windows on Arm and WSL2.

**Two cheaper options worth knowing about:**
* **clvk**, a conformant OpenCL 3.0 built on Vulkan ([Vulkan docs](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/Advanced_Vulkan_Compute/05_OpenCL_on_Vulkan/01_introduction.html)), gives OpenCL on machines that only have Vulkan drivers without changing any Omnifilter code. Users install it as an OpenCL driver. Running it on macOS through MoltenVK is unproven.
* **Rusticl on Zink** (Mesa) is another OpenCL-over-Vulkan route, and OpenCL 3.1 conformant on some drivers. Whether it works on NVIDIA's own Vulkan driver is untested.
* **pocl's own GPU drivers** (CUDA, Level Zero, Vulkan) are less mature, but worth a test on NVIDIA under WSL2.

**Considered and not chosen (October 2026):** Halide (excellent for image pipelines, but a rewrite into ahead-of-time C++ pipelines), SYCL via AdaptiveCpp or DPC++ (heavy toolchain aimed at HPC; Apple support only emerging), CubeCL (Rust, pre-1.0), Kompute or raw Vulkan (WebGPU already runs on Vulkan with far less code), and separate CUDA or Metal ports (Slang can generate those later if needed).

## Phase 4: the GPU in the browser

With WGSL kernels from Phase 3, the page can run filters on the viewer's own GPU through WebGPU. It's now in Chrome/Edge, in Safari 26, and in Firefox on Windows and on Apple Silicon Macs. Firefox on Linux and older hardware still lag, so this is an enhancement, with the server as the fallback ([status summary](https://svilenkovic.com/3d/webgpu-adoption-2026)).

* **Live preview:** filter a screen-sized copy in the browser as sliders move, then send the stack to the server for the full-resolution result. This also gives the before/after slider idea from the effects list for free.
* **Shared code:** move each kernel's WGSL into files both the server and the client bundle load, so a fix applies to both.
* **Fallback:** browsers without WebGPU keep the current flow, where the server does everything.

## Phase 5: neural styles on the GPU

The ONNX styles currently run on the CPU. ONNX Runtime has GPU "execution providers": CUDA (NVIDIA), DirectML (Windows), CoreML (Apple) and WebGPU ([ONNX Runtime docs](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/)). Which ones the `onnxruntime-node` npm package ships differs by version and platform, and we're pinned to 1.19.2 for macOS 12, so the first step is to check what's actually in the package. Then add `OMNIFILTER_ORT_PROVIDERS` (e.g. `cuda,cpu`) with automatic fallback to the CPU, and log which provider loaded.

## Testing matrix

| Where | What it proves | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Actions, Linux: pocl + Rusticl/llvmpipe | Kernels are portable across two OpenCL compilers; Docker image builds | Free, every push |
| GitHub Actions, macOS (Apple Silicon) | Builds and runs on Apple's OpenCL, if the runner VM exposes a GPU; otherwise the CPU device | Free; check first whether OpenCL works in the runner |
| GitHub Actions, Windows | Builds with the Khronos loader; tests run on WARP or are skipped | Free |
| Cloud GPU spot instance, run by hand before releases | NVIDIA path, `nvidia` Docker image | A few dollars per run |
| Any real hardware to hand (an AMD or Intel Linux box, an Apple Silicon Mac, a Mali board) | Vendor-driver quirks | Free, ad hoc |

## Suggested order

1. **Phase 0.** A few days. It fixes known bugs (the work-group size, the 16384 cap) and makes every later step safer.
2. **Phases 1 and 2.** About a week together. Windows, prebuilt binaries and GPU Docker images cover most real hardware with the existing kernels.
3. **Phase 3.** The big one: weeks, mostly porting kernels. Do it once Dawn's Node bindings stabilise, or sooner if Apple removes OpenCL.
4. **Phase 4.** After Phase 3, since it reuses the WGSL.
5. **Phase 5.** Independent of the others; can happen whenever.
